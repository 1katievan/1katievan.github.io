                        <h4>Indie Game Website | Katar Studios</h4>
                        <p>A web development project on a 0$ budget to create a website showcasing my upcoming indie game project.</p>

                        <section class="col-md-12 col-lg-12">
                                                        <p><strong>(Note: As of 9/28/19, KatarStudios website is still under development as this post was written. Take a look at <a href="https://KatarStudios.github.io">KatarStudios.github.io</a>!</strong>)</p>
                            <h5 style="margin-top: 42px;">Background</h5>
                            <p>Katar Studios is the name I have for my collection of video game creations. As of now I have published one game and with another game coming on the way, I've decided that Katar Studios needed a home in the form of a website. As a fun twist, I decided to create the website with a 0$ budget. Read more to learn the details of user interface design, coding specifics (with a 0$ budget), and graphic design decisions I made.</p>
                            
                            <h5 style="margin-top: 42px;">User interface design</h5>
                            <p>Regarding user interface design, the first thing I did was to create a list of exactly what features I needed for my indie game website. (Or in UI design terms, I conducted a user needs analysis). The website needed to act as a 'home page' for everything related to Katar Studios and my games (especially my upcoming game), needed a prominent email collection box, and needed to match both the fun vibe of Katar Studios but also the darker vibe of my newest game.</p>
                            <p>With that in mind, I designed the home page to have a large hero image to feature the upcoming game, with the email collection box displayed prominently before anything else. Scrolling down would reveal displays of both of my games, and below that, space for listing any blog posts. Below is the final wireframe sketch I came up with for the KatarStudios home page.</p>
                            <img style="box-shadow: 0px 5px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.6);" src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/020/920/624/large/katie-van-katarstudioswebsitesketch.jpg?1569690077">
                            
                            <h5 style="margin-top: 42px;">Web development</h5>
                            <p>The website itself is responsive (works on mobile, tablet, desktop, etc.) and was created with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My total budget, including hosting costs and everything, was <strong>$0</strong>. Because of this, I had to find creative solutions for features such as email collection and blog posts. It makes use of google forms and google spreadsheet API to act as a free, impromptu database to store emails and blog posts. For hosting, I using Github pages (also free). If I were to repeat the project again, I would use a framework like bootstrap to speed up the development of the user interface. In fact, this is what I did for my next personal website, the portfolio you are currently looking at.</p>
                            
                            <h5 style="margin-top: 42px;">Graphic design</h5>
                            <p>The challenge of this website is that my first game was a very light and happy endless runner mobile game, my upcoming game is for PC and has a darker, grittier atmosphere with psychological, horror-esque, and sims-like elements. Meanwhile I would say the vibe that I want in general is 'playful'. To create the playfull vibe I decided to use vibrant green(which happens to be my favourite color) and orange as accent colors, with blacks and whites for my main colors. The balance of black and white can easily be changed to fit whichever game I am showcasing. I created the custom hero image to create a similar vibe as my upcoming game and combined it with site colors. I wrote about the custom promo art in <a href="indie-game-promo-art.html">this post</a>.</p>
